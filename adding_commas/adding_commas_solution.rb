# Commit 1 - Research

# 1. The p statement lets you know it's an array of strings

# Commit 2 - Pseudocode

# input:   Intger   5   299     1818     99999999
# output:  String  "5" "299"   "1,818"  "9,999,999"

# Steps
# 1 - Read the length of the integer  
# 2 - If longer than 3 chars add commas where needed
# 3 - Loop through number and add commas

# Commit 3 - Initial Solution

def add_commas(number)
  # write code here  
end

# Commit 5 - Refactor Solution



# Commit 4 - Write Runner Code / Tests

puts add_commas(5) == "5" # I've written the first test, write the rest on your own.
